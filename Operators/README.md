What Are Operators in Python?
Operators are special symbols in Python used to perform operations on variables and values.
Example:
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)   # Output: 15


Python has 7 major types of operators:

1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Assignment Operators
3.Comparison (Relational) Operators
4.Logical Operators
5.Bitwise Operators
6.Membership Operators
7.Identity Operators


1 Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description         | Example        |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition            | `10 + 5 → 15`  |
| -        | Subtraction         | `10 - 5 → 5`   |
| *        | Multiplication      | `10 * 5 → 50`  |
| /        | Division            | `10 / 4 → 2.5` |
| %        | Modulus (remainder) | `10 % 3 → 1`   |
| **       | Exponent            | `2 ** 3 → 8`   |
| //       | Floor division      | `10 // 3 → 3`  |


2 Assignment Operators
| Operator | Meaning                 | Example   |
| -------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| =        | Assign                  | `x = 5`   |
| +=       | Add and assign          | `x += 3`  |
| -=       | Subtract and assign     | `x -= 3`  |
| *=       | Multiply and assign     | `x *= 3`  |
| /=       | Divide and assign       | `x /= 3`  |
| %=       | Modulus and assign      | `x %= 3`  |
| //=      | Floor divide and assign | `x //= 3` |
| **=      | Exponent and assign     | `x **= 2` |


3 Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning          | Example           |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| ==       | Equal to         | `10 == 10 → True` |
| !=       | Not equal to     | `10 != 5 → True`  |
| >        | Greater than     | `10 > 5 → True`   |
| <        | Less than        | `5 < 10 → True`   |
| >=       | Greater or equal | `10 >= 10 → True` |
| <=       | Less or equal    | `5 <= 5 → True`   |


4 Logical Operators
| Operator | Meaning                          | Example              |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| and      | True if both conditions are true | `(5 > 3 and 10 > 5)` |
| or       | True if one condition is true    | `(5 > 3 or 1 > 5)`   |
| not      | Reverse result                   | `not(5 > 3)`         |


5 Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Meaning     | Example       |        |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ |
| &        | AND         | `5 & 3 → 1`   |        |
| |        | OR          | `5            | 3 → 7` |
| ^        | XOR         | `5 ^ 3 → 6`   |        |
| ~        | NOT         | `~5 → -6`     |        |
| <<       | Left shift  | `5 << 1 → 10` |        |
| >>       | Right shift | `5 >> 1 → 2`  |        |


6 Membership Operators
| Operator | Meaning           | Example              |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| in       | True if found     | `"a" in "apple"`     |
| not in   | True if not found | `"b" not in "apple"` |


7 Identity Operators
| Operator | Meaning         | Example      |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| is       | Same object     | `a is b`     |
| is not   | Not same object | `a is not b` |
